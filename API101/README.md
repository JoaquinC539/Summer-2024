This repository documents my journey as I learn to work with APIs. As a beginner, I aim to continuously improve my skills and knowledge in this area.
This README provides an overview of my current progress, projects, and plans for future learning.

# Current Status #

I have just started learning how to use APIs. This repository will serve as a collection of my notes, code examples, and projects related to APIs. I will regularly update this repository with new content as I learn more.

# 1. API_intro.py #

My first project is a simple API to understand the basics of making API requests and handling responses as json format using the Flask python library.
I have also installed and started ;earning the Postman software for a better understanding.

# Future Plans #

I plan to explore the following topics as I progress:
- Authentication and Authorization (OAuth, API Keys)
- Consuming and creating RESTful APIs
- Working with GraphQL APIs
- Integrating APIs with front-end and back-end applications
- Error handling and debugging in API interactions
- Building my own APIs

# Contributing #

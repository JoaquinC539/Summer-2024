# PHP and SQL Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey as I learn PHP and SQL. I aim to continue to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas.

## Current Status

I have just started learning how to use PHP and SQL. This repository will serve as a collection of my notes, code examples, and projects related to these technologies.
I will regularly update this repository with new content as I learn more throughout Summer 2024.

## Projects

### 1. Basic PHP and SQL Integration

My first project involves creating a simple PHP application that interacts with a MySQL database. The application includes basic functionalities like user registration, login, and data retrieval.
This program is functional, as I have left documentation of other basic syntax in `notes.php` to refer to it on future projects.
